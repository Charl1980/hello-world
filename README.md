## User Stories
1. As a new user, I want to be able to easily enter a chat room so I can quickly start talking to my friends and family.
2. As a user, I want to be able to send messages to my friends and family members to exchange the latest news.
3. As a user, I want to send images to my friends to show them what Iâ€™m currently doing.

## Development Process
### Setup Expo as Development Environment
1. Install Expo CLI
```
npm install expo-cli --location=global

2. Create a new expo project
```
expo init [projectname]
```

3. Navigate to the project
```
cd [projectname]
```

4. Start expo project

npm start or expo start
```

### Install React Navigation library to navigate between screens

1. Navigate to project folder and run
```
npm install react-navigation

```

3. Update presets and add plugin to babel.config.js file
```
module.exports = function (api) {
  api.cache(true);
  return {
    //presets: ['babel-preset-expo'],
    presets: ['module:metro-react-native-babel-preset'],
    plugins: ['react-native-reanimated/plugin'],
  };
};
```

### Set up Android Studio as Android Emulator

```
export ANDROID_SDK=/Users/myuser/Library/Android/sdk
export PATH=/Users/myuser/Library/Android/sdk/platform-tools:$PATH
```

4. Create virtual device and click play to start

5. Select 'Run app on Android' in Expo to run app on virtual device

### Install React Native library Gifted Chat for developing chat apps

## How to run the project
You can use any Emulator or Simulator to run the app on your device. To test this app, I have used Expo Go on iOS and the Android Emulator. To test the app with Expo, follow the below steps:

1. Clone repository: git clone https://github.com/Charl1980/hello-world

2. Install Expo CLI as a global npm package: npm install --global expo-cli

3. Install all dependecies: npm install

4. Start project: expo start / npx expo start

5. Launch the app on Expo
